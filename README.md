# `libft` - C standard library reloaded

## Description
`libft` is in many ways a foundational project in *42 schools* (of which Hive is part of). It is the second project of the curriculum, and it's encouraged to be expanded throughout the studies when required. In Hive, excluding `malloc(3)` and `free(3)`, all of C standard library is forbidden. You use it, you code it.
